These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to the software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if any. The terms also apply to any Microsoft
* updates,
* supplements,
* Internet-based services, and
* support services
for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those terms apply. By using the software you accept these terms. If you do not accept them, do not use the software.
If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below.
1. SCOPE OF RIGHTS. 
You may use, copy, modify, creative derivative works, and distribute the Software for non-commercial, non-production purposes, subject to the restrictions in this MSR-LA. Examples of non-commercial, non-production uses are teaching, academic research, public demonstrations and personal experimentation. 
In return, we simply require that you agree: 
* If you distribute the Software or any derivative works of the Software, you will distribute them under a non-commercial use, non-production use license and require any further distributions be under a non-commercial, non-production use license, and you will not grant other rights to the Software or derivative works that are different from those provided by this license. 
* If you have created derivative works of the software, and distribute such derivative works subject to the license rights herein, you will cause the modified files to carry prominent notices so that recipients know that they are not receiving the original software. Such notices must state: (i) that you have changed the software; and (ii) the date of any changes.
* That Microsoft is granted back, without any restrictions or limitations, a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, assignable and sub-licensable license, to reproduce, publicly perform or display, install, use, modify, post, distribute, make and have made, sell and transfer your modifications to and/or derivative works of the Software source code or data, for any purpose. 
* Not to alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the software;
* Not to use Microsoft’s trademarks in your programs’ names or in a way that suggests your derivative works or modifications come from or are endorsed by Microsoft; and
* Not to include the software in malicious, deceptive or unlawful programs.
2. TERM; TERMINATION. The term of this Agreement will commence upon your acceptance of these license terms and will continue indefinitely unless terminated as provided herein. If you breach this agreement or if you sue anyone over patents that you think may apply to or read on the software or anyone's use of the software, this agreement (and your license and rights obtained herein) terminate automatically. 
If this agreement is terminated, (a) you must return or destroy all full or partial copies of the software in your possession immediately and (b) if applicable, you must cease distributing any derivative works or modifications. Any sections that are intended to survive termination of this agreement shall survive.
3. FEEDBACK. That any feedback about the Software provided by you to us is voluntarily given, and Microsoft shall be free to use the feedback as it sees fit without obligation or restriction of any kind, even if the feedback is designated by you as confidential. 
4. SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. The patent rights, if any, granted to you in this MSR-LA only apply to the Software, not to any derivative works you make. In using the Software, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not:
* work around any technical limitations in the software;
* reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation;
* make more copies of the software than specified in this agreement or allowed by applicable law, despite this limitation;
* rent, lease or lend the software;
* transfer the software or this agreement to any third party; or
* use the software for commercial software hosting services.
5. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For additional information, see www.microsoft.com/exporting.
6. ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.
7. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Washington, without reference to its choice of law principles to the contrary. Each party hereby consents to the jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in King County, Washington, with regard to any suit or claim arising under or by reason of this Agreement. 
8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. The software is licensed “as-is.” You bear the risk of using it. Microsoft gives no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights or statutory guarantees under your local laws which this agreement cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, Microsoft excludes the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.
9. LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES. You can recover from Microsoft and its suppliers only direct damages up to U.S. $5.00. You cannot recover any other damages, including consequential, lost profits, special, indirect or incidental damages.
This limitation applies to
* anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and
* claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
