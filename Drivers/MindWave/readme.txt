This is the HomeOS driver for the Mindwave device http://store.neurosky.com/products/mindwave-1

Required binaries: 
	You must install and run the MindWave Mobile Core software that comes on the CD
	The driver needs to reference the Mindwave role (RoleMindWave). The source for this custom role is in Hub\Custom\RoleMindWave 

Sample app for HomeOS: MentalHouse

You will also need to modify some config files (see the files in _ModifyConfigs dir) in order for the driver to run.
