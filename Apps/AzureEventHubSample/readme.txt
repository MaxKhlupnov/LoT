This sample app shows how to send sensor data to an Azure Event Hub.

Event Hubs is a highly scalable ingestion system that can process millions of events per second, enabling your application to process and analyze the massive amounts of data produced by your connected devices and applications. Once collected into Event Hubs, you can transform and store data using any real-time analytics provider or storage cluster.
